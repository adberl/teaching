# Homework 1

### How does it work?
Enter the name of students in the ``students.txt`` file (one per line) and launch ``./run.sh`` from the terminal.

### Why does it not work for me?
The shell script is made for GNU/Linux. You need ``python3`` and ``pdflatex`` for it to work (download them from your distribution's package repository). Additionally, you may need to allow execute rights for the script with ``chmod +x run.sh``.
